**Overview:**
The Internew is a dynamic interactive installation designed for the REBOOT exhibition at the New Institute, dedicated to exploring digital art. Tasked with creating an engaging "maakplek" (a Dutch term for a creative space), our objective was to provide visitors with a unique and immersive platform for collectively expressing their thoughts on the current and future state of the internet.

**Concept:**
At its core, the installation features several touch screens, creating an immersive experience for participants. Internew is driven by a chat bot that prompts users to share their perspectives on the internet. Participants are encouraged to articulate their likes and dislikes, contemplating the current state of the internet and envisioning its future.

**Interactive Process:**
As users input their responses, the screens dynamically generate related words and images, fostering a collaborative and imaginative environment. This iterative process allows participants to construct a collage-like composition, visually representing their vision for the internet of the future.

**Ethical Dilemmas:**
Internew goes beyond mere visualization, challenging participants to take a stance on critical ethical dilemmas related to freedom of speech, sustainability, and funding. Depending on their choices, the installation adapts the composition, introducing elements like ads, altering resolution, or implementing censorship. This dynamic element emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of the internet's evolution.

**Collective Canvas:**
Upon completion, participants contribute their unique compositions to a vast digital canvas, showcasing the collective creativity and diverse perspectives of all recent visitors. This shared canvas serves as a living testament to the myriad visions and ethical considerations surrounding the future of the internet.

**Impact:**
Internew not only offers a playful and interactive means of engaging with the exhibition's theme but also serves as a catalyst for dialogue and reflection. By encouraging participants to actively shape and confront the future of the internet, the installation transforms the spectator into a contributor, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and awareness.

**Outcome:**
The project successfully fulfills its mission as a "maakplek," providing visitors with an immersive and thought-provoking experience that transcends the traditional boundaries of exhibition spaces. Internew stands as a testament to the power of interactive art in sparking conversations and shaping collective visions for the digital landscape.
