*Conceptualization:*
Nike's House of Innovation in Paris sought an innovative way to showcase their manifesto amidst an array of light-emitting screens. The solution arose in the form of the Manifesto Wall—a visually striking installation composed of 600 passive e-ink displays. This choice not only aligned with Nike's commitment to innovation but also provided a sustainable alternative to the existing screens, blending technology and ambiance seamlessly.

*Technical Development:*
The Manifesto Wall featured 50 Raspberry Pi-controlled modules, each overseeing 16 A5-sized e-ink displays. Collaborating with Frolic Studio, a custom PCB was crafted to optimize control and synchronization. Leveraging WebRTC technology, the clocks of all Raspberry Pis were synchronized, ensuring seamless coordination. A user-friendly content management system allowed Nike designers to upload content, intelligently calculated and distributed across modules for a dynamic display.

*Collaboration Dynamics:*
The collaborative process unfolded through a series of sprints, each with distinct deliverables. From proving the technology's feasibility to fine-tuning displays and synchronization, the teams iteratively refined the project. Frolic Studio's expertise in hardware engineering and user interfaces complemented Fiction Factory's proficiency in installation logistics, leading to a seamless collaboration that culminated in the successful installation in Paris.

*User Interaction:*
The Manifesto Wall aimed to deliver an engaging user experience. The user-friendly interface empowered Nike designers to curate content dynamically. The large-scale installation, with 600 e-ink displays, provided an immersive experience, ensuring a cohesive narrative across the entire wall. Visitors at Nike's House of Innovation in Paris were treated to a captivating interaction with the brand's manifesto.

In essence, the Manifesto Wall stands as a testament to the fusion of technology, sustainability, and innovation—a symphony of e-ink displays orchestrating Nike's vision in the heart of their flagship store in Paris.
