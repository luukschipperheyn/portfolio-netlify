I M U is an interactive film installation in which we manipulate the viewerâ€™s image through deepfake.

The viewer is invited to enter a booth, where they see a film. Through different means, the viewer's self image becomes the main character. The mirror image of the viewer is superimposed over the film by way of a semi-transparent mirror and a light. At some point, a live-generated deepfake of the viewer gets mixed in with the pre-rendered film, at which point, the viewer loses agency over their own image.
