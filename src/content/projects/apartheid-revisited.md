Apartheid Revisited invites you to learn about apartheid by zooming through an information landscape, ingeniously designed by Ruiter Janssen. It shows the history, applies a human scale to the numbers and gives opportunity to reflect upon our current times.

Ruiter asked Afdeling Buitengewone Zaken to help him take his work - which usually manifests itself on paper - into the digital realm. We took an iterative approach; starting with lo-fi sketches and reflecting upon experiments, the design and its technical implementation emerged simultaneously.

I created a tool that allowed us to integrate a 3D-model, exported from Blender, with our ThreeJS environment. This allowed Ruiter and me to work closely together and quickly try out new things.

Technology used:

- JavaScript
- VueJS
- ThreeJS
- Blender
