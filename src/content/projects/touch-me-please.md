*Touch Me Please* is a manifestation of Alissa + Nienke's visionary approach to spaces dedicated to well-being. Envisioned as designers exploring the potential of spatial design to enhance the well-being of occupants, this project emerged as a testament to their commitment to creating immersive and therapeutic environments. The inspiration behind the large felt wall, adorned with diverse textures, lies in fostering an interactive experience that invites individuals to center themselves, stepping away from the complexities of the mind.

I built hardware and software for the project, using MPR121 capacitive sensing ICs in conjunction with Arduino and Raspberry Pi units. The meticulous fine-tuning of touch sensitivity was a key aspect, ensuring a nuanced and responsive interaction with the felt surfaces. The designers had access to a web interface where they could adjust parameters and upload sounds. This technical foundation not only facilitated a seamless user experience but also empowered designers to tailor the sensory engagement, enriching the overall impact of the project.
