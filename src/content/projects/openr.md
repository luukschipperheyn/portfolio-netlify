Openr is an intercom and access control service. A touch screen interface enables your guests to call you and the app allows you to open the door, no matter if you are in the building or not.

Openr opens ca. 150 doors for more than 4000 people each day.

I have maintained the project since 2017 and developed a new version of the mobile app, which adds a video calling feature.
